# Motivation
This session is going to be a little different than the others. 
We will be working with more challenges and exploring different way of combining the things we have learned these days.
So we will spend more time in break-out rooms solving challenges and being "hands-on" while in the 
plenary session we will talk about how we solved the challenges and if things are behaving as we expect or not and why.

Before the break, and a little scattered through the sessions, we have been combining the things we have learned. 
It's when we start using the tidyverse as a whole, all functions together that they start really becoming powerful.
In this last session, we will be working on the things we have learned and applying them together in ways that
uncover some of the cool things we can get done.

Lets say we want to summarise _all_ the measurement variables, i.e. all the columns containing "_". 
We've learned about summaries and grouped summaries. 
Can you think of a way we can do that using the things we've learned?

We've done this before, why is it a clue now? Now that we have learned grouping and summarising, 
what if we now also group by the new name column to get summaries for each column as a row already here!


~~~
penguins %>% 
  pivot_longer(contains("_")) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))
~~~
{: .language-r}

# A tibble: 4 × 2

Now we are talking! Now we have the mean of each of our observational columns! Lets add other common summary statistics.


~~~
penguins %>% 
  pivot_longer(contains("_")) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    min = min(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    max = max(value, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 4 × 5

1 bill_depth_mm       17.2   1.97   13.1   21.5

4 flipper_length_mm  201.   14.1   172    231

{: .output}

That's a pretty neat table! The repetition of `na.rm = TRUE` in all is a little tedious, though. Let us use an extra argument in the pivot longer to remove `NA`s in the value column


~~~
penguins %>% 
  pivot_longer(contains("_")) %>%
  drop_na(value) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    min = min(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    max = max(value, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

Now we have a pretty decent summary table of our data.

## Plotting summaries

Now that we have the summaries, we can use them in plots too! But keep typing or copying the same code over and over is tedious. 
So let us save the summary in its own object, and keep using that.


~~~
penguins_sum <- penguins %>% 
  pivot_longer(contains("_")) %>% 
  drop_na(value) %>% 
  group_by(name, species, island) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(value),
    sd   = sd(value),
    min  = min(value),
    max  = max(value),
    n = n()
  ) %>% 
  ungroup()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'name', 'species'. You can override using
the `.groups` argument.
~~~
{: .output}

We can for instance make a bar chart with the values from the summary statistics.


~~~
penguins_sum %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = island,
             y = mean,
             fill = species)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in `f()`:
! stat_count() can only have an x or y aesthetic.
~~~
{: .error}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This error message is telling us that we have used an aesthetic that is not needed in geom_bar. 
That is because geom_bar calculates frequencies by calling `stat_count`. 
But we don't want to count, we already have the values we want to plot.
The ggplot geoms that calculates statistics for plots (like geom bar), have a "stat" option.
When we already have calculated the stat, we can let the geom know to use the values as they are by using `stat = "identity"`.



~~~
penguins_sum %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = island, 
             y = mean,
             fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free")
~~~

That is starting to look like something nice. But the way the bars for the species are stacking on top of each other is making it a little hard to read. 
In ggplot, there is an argument called "position", that could help us. 
By default in the bar charts position is set to "stacked". 
We should try the "dodge" option.


~~~
penguins_sum %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = island, 
             y = mean,
             fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           position = "dodge") +

## Facetting extra long data

But we can get even more creative! 
We mentioned in the pivoting session, that pivoting data is a key skill to really discover how powerful a tool the tidyverse can be.
It's when you start thinking of pivoting as solutions to various tasks that is gets super interesting. 
For instance, in our summary data, we have 4 different statistics, and its hard to get them all nicely into a plot. 
But they all give us some information about the underlying data. 
How can we create a plot that showcases them all?

We can pivot _even longer_ and create subplots for each statistic!


~~~
penguins_sum %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(mean, sd, min, max)))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error: <text>:2:38: unexpected ')'
1: penguins_sum %>% 
2:   pivot_longer(c(mean, sd, min, max)))
                                        ^
~~~
{: .error}

What is this error? We already have a column named `name` so when we try to let pivot_longer make another one, we get an error.
 Tibbles will not let you create columns with the same name, thankfully! That would be confusing. 
 Let us make sure the new pivoted column with column names has a distinct name.


~~~
penguins_sum %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(mean, sd, min, max),
               names_to = "stat")
~~~
{: .language-r}

{: .output}

Now that we have our extra long data, we can try plotting it all! 
We will switch `facet_wrap()` to `facet_grid()` which creates a grid of subplots. 
The formula for the grid is using both side of the `~` sign. 
And you can think of it like `rows ~ columns`.
So here we are saying we want the `stats` values as rows, and `name` values as columns in the plot grid.


~~~
penguins_sum %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(mean, sd, min, max),
               names_to = "stat") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species, 
             y = value,
             fill = island)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           position = "dodge") +
  facet_grid(stat ~ name)

> > `facet_grid` is more complex than `facet_wrap` as it will always force the y-axis for rows, and x-axis for columns remain the same.
> > So wile setting scales to free will help a little, it will only do so within each row and column, not each subplot. 
> > When the results do not look as you like, swapping what are rows and columns in the grid can often create better results.
